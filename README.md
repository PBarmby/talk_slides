# talk_slides
Hi folks — please upload your talk slides (keynote, contributed,
lightning; we’d like whatever you’re prepared to share) here.

This is in addition to the one-slide-per-person requested by Fred,
although if you want to put that one slide in this same repo that’s fine.

PDF format would be best; please name them with your last name
so we can figure out what’s what, and put them in the correct directory
for the talk date.

The plan is to get a DOI for this repo from Zenodo (which I think will
make it like a conference proceeding?)
